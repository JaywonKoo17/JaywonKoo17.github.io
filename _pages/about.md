Hi!

I am an MS student in Computer Science at Columbia University. My research interests lie in the areas of **multimodal deep learning, speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing**. I work on Multimodal problems in [Speech Lab](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/speech/lab.cgi), advised by Prof. [Julia Hirschberg](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/).

I am broadly interested in making a deep learning model that interprets the world and outputs as humans do: in designing a multimodal AI system where it uses speech, natural language, and vision to understand the world.

I have also worked with Prof. [Shih-Fu Chang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/) at Columbia University. There, I worked on multimodal event-event relation detection.

Before starting my MS, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Ewha Womans University in 2021. I was fortunate to be advised by [Dongbo Min](http://cvl.ewha.ac.kr/) and [Hyun-Seok Park](http://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewha/professor/info.do?mode=view&pId=xPCsLydiqzj%2FKdbYExXJKg%3D%3D) at Ewha Womans University.
