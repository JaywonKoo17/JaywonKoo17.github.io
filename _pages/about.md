Hi!

I am a first year computer science PhD student at [Vislang Lab](https://vislang.ai/) at [Rice University](https://csweb.rice.edu/), advised by [Prof. Vicente Ordonez](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/).

I completed my MS in Computer Science from [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), where I worked on multimodal emotion detection in [Speech Lab](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/speech/lab.cgi), advised by Prof. [Julia Hirschberg](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/). I have also worked with Prof. [Shih-Fu Chang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/) at Columbia University.

Previously, I graduated from Ewha Womans University with B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering, and Scranton Honors Program in 2021, where I was advised by Prof. [Dongbo Min](http://cvl.ewha.ac.kr/) and by Prof. [Hyun-Seok Park](http://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewha/professor/info.do?mode=view&pId=xPCsLydiqzj%2FKdbYExXJKg%3D%3D) .
