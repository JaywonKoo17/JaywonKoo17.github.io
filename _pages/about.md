Hi!

I am a MS student at Computer Science at Columbia University. My research interests lie in the areas of multimodal deep learning, speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Julia Hirschberg[(http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/).

I am broadly interested in making a deep learning model which interprets world and outputs as humans do: in desgining multimodal ai system where it uses speech, natural languge and vision to understand the world.  

I have also worked with Prof. [Shih-Fu Chang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang/) at Columbia University and Hammad Ayyubi. Prior to starting my MS, I received my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Ewha Womans University in 2021. I was fortunate to be advised by [Dongbo Min](http://cvl.ewha.ac.kr/) and [Hyun-Seok Park](http://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewha/professor/info.do?mode=view&pId=xPCsLydiqzj%2FKdbYExXJKg%3D%3D) at Ewha Womans University.
